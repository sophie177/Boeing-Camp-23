# change var values, now what will print

# what part is the output?
# what is our result?

  poopy(10, 10, 10) 
else:
  poopy(3, 15, 9)
# change conditional operator to != and ask what would execute now
# bonus points if they can explain why 

while(a < 6): # How many times will this execute?
  print("loop")
  a = a + 1 # what does this do? What is it called?

word = ["f", "a", "r", "t"]
# what is this?
# what datatype is held in this list?

for letter in word:
  print(letter)
# what will print?
# What is the trigger/condition for the loop to end?  

# why is a loop different from an if statement?
# what is a similarity between a loop and an if statement? (hint: they both use a condition to determine when they execute)

# When do we indent? (after an if, else, while loop, or for loop
